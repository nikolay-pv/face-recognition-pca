Realisation of PCA face recognition.

The custom class for PCAFaceRecognizer is implemented.
Face recognizer is used on set of 2D/3D data of the faces, where the latter is a gray scale picture with depth values.
Combined approach is implemented, when two recognizers are created and a combination of predicted distances is used to recognize the face.
